# Teammate Motivator

This is the source code for the Teammate Motivator iOS app, developed in Objective-C in the dark(er) ages before Swift.

The primary purpose of the app is to assist athletic coaches (or leaders/managers in other contexts) in efficiently gathering honest **peer assessment** data
from members of their team. As the administrative user of the app, the coach can freely compose assessment items using a simple template system
(e.g., *"How do you rate ____'s reaction to setbacks?*) and supply the desired answer choices. During a given practice session, the coach uses the app
to take attendance, followed by selecting a subset of their item bank to assess that day. Each player is then prompted to confidentially rate each
other player on those items, and the coach can view aggregrate data over time.
